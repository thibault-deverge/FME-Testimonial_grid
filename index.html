					“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
					make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
					I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
					shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of
					my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
					working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

					Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

				<blockquote class="testimonial__quote">
					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
					structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I
					was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
					wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
					disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
					The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
					the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often
					referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
					certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
					multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
